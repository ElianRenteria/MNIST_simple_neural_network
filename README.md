## Introduction

MNIST Simple Neural Network is a basic implementation of a neural network that classifies handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. This project serves as an educational tool for understanding the fundamentals of neural networks and deep learning.

## Features

- Simple feedforward neural network
- MNIST dataset for training and testing
- Accuracy evaluation of the model
- Easy-to-understand code structure

## Installation

To install and set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ElianRenteria/MNIST_simple_neural_network.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd MNIST_simple_neural_network
   ```
3. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   [installation command, e.g., pip install -r requirements.txt]
   ```

## Usage

After installation, you can train and test the neural network with the following command:

```bash
[command to run the training script, e.g., python train.py]
```

The model will be trained on the MNIST dataset, and you can evaluate its performance using the provided testing script.
